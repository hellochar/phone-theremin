# Accelerometer Instrument

An app that plays music via the accelerometer input from a phone or tablet (or even an old MacBook!). To run, start up a local server 

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
Then go to the address
```
0.0.0.0:8000
```
on your browser.


You can even invite your friends to play with you if they connect to your IP address on the same internet! Check your IP via
```
ifconfig
```
and find `inet`
